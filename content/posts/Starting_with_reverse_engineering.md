## What tools I use {#what-tools-i-use}

I started out with ghidra and found that rather slow and slugish. I am a big emacs and vim user so efficiency is a must. Luckily I knew about `radare2`. Radare2 is a command line tool to disassemble and reverse binaries plus much much more. I found that radare was easier to use for small binaries like the ones from [crackmes](https://crackmes.one).


## Resources {#resources}

In my opinion LiveOverflow playlist on binary exploitation is amazing and as a bigginer is a great place. After watching the starter videos I went to a website called microcorruption that has many CTF like reversing challenges. These are great as no program is needed because the dissasembler is on the website all ready. Finnaly I went to the hardest challenge yet... `Crackmes.one` This website offers crackmes that people have made in order for you to reverse and make a keygen.


## Objective {#objective}

Right now my main goal is to be able to succesfully reverse and build a keygen for any crackme in crackmes.one with a difficulty level of 3. The levels are 1 to 6 where 1 is the easiest, so going for a level 3 is considering myself as a intermidiate reverser. During my solves I will be posting solutions and my mental process.
