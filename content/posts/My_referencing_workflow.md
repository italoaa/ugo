## Introduction {#introduction}

This workflow utilizes the following packages:

-   org-ref
-   bibtex
-   bibtex-completion
-   org-roam-bibtex
-   ivy bibtex
-   org noter

This workflow allows me to quickly extract the data from a paper with just the `DOI.` This data is then turned into a biblatex entry that I can later use in my citation when I write on org-latex. I write in org mode which is then exported to everything else. Even this blog is written in org mode. Now that I have the biblatex entry I can choose to add a PDF to it. This is really handy as while I write anything if I click the citation I can directly open that PDF. To wrap everything up I use org noter to add anotations to PDF in exact places. An example of this could be a arbitrary number of pages essay that I am reading. On page 8 there is an interesting Idea that I want to comment and could be usefull for my own writing. Now this citation has easy to access notes that havee references to the actual writing.
