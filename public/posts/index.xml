      <description>What is SSH This is the main protocol for communicating with your server so make sure is properly set up. For me the most important aspect to add is SSH-keys. This are like files in your system that are used to authenticate with the server. This is used instead of a password.
How to configure SSH Config File The following config are some of my definitive.
This is in /etc/ssh/sshd_config</description>

      <description>Nginx Install This is the web server that will handle all http/s connections.
sudo apt install nginx Configuration Decide on a name for the nginx configuration and create a new config for nginx. In case you are not familiar with nginx the configurations of the web server go inside /etc/nginx/sites-available/. The sites available directory is used to store the configurations. To enable the configurations you can symlink then to the /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ directory.</description>

      <title>Starting with reverse engineering</title>

      <description>What tools I use I started out with ghidra and found that rather slow and slugish. I am a big emacs and vim user so efficiency is a must. Luckily I knew about radare2. Radare2 is a command line tool to disassemble and reverse binaries plus much much more. I found that radare was easier to use for small binaries like the ones from crackmes.
Resources In my opinion LiveOverflow playlist on binary exploitation is amazing and as a bigginer is a great place.</description>

      <description>Hugo Now that I have a server I started to play around with the site generation of hugo. It can be a bit complicated If you are using emacs and org mode like me so I will divide this explanation in to three parts: Ox-Hugo (You can skip this if you are using only md), Content Organization and Configurations.
Set up hugo Download hugo You are going to want to install hugo in your personal machine apart from your server.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer Most of the information here is taken from the tutorial in Land Chad check them out!
Introduction and process. This is the process I went through while making this same website. At first I tried to make a basic html and css website but my design skills where not enough. I also considered using Hugo because I use org mode almost daily and there is a package called ox-hugo, which makes transformation of the org-mode syntax into the markdown for hugo simple.</description>
